# time-to-fill-analysis
## Objective  
This project analyzes the average number of days it takes to fill roles across departments using simulated internal recruiting data. The goal was to identify potential bottlenecks and suggest improvements to hiring workflows.

## Dataset  
The dataset includes 100 simulated job entries with fields for department, recruiter, requisition date, and hire date. A calculated column shows time-to-fill in days.

## Method  
- Google Sheets used to create pivot tables and visuals  
- Average time-to-fill calculated by department  
- Chart created to visualize departmental differences  

## Key Findings  
- **Engineering** had the longest average time-to-fill at 23.5 days  
- Other departments were tightly grouped between 21.9–22.4 days  
- Engineering may face longer approval chains or technical candidate shortages

## Recommendation  
Explore pipeline building or process streamlining for engineering roles.
